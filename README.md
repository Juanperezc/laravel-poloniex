### Installation

Since this is only the initial commit and I haven't done too much, just wrapped the API in Client.php, you'll have to add it to your composer.json file manualy:

```

"require": {
    "htunlogic/laravel-poloniex": "@dev"
}

```

Run `composer update` or `composer install` and copy the `config/poloniex.php` into your projects `config/` file.
